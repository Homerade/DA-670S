# the Wheels of Civic Action App
This project is being developed for DA 670S-Web Development Studio in the Digital Arts graduate program at Goucher College. The project draws inspiration from the use of technology for civic prosperity and will be developed using React.JS.

## the Project
Initially the concept was to create a mobile app that allowed users to search for events and other civic actions by location, date and issue.

:bomb: :boom: days later the [resistance calendar](https://www.resistancecalendar.org/) came out and I found [we protest today](https://www.weprotest.today/). They were already doing it. Better and with more people than I was.

Now on to a new, if not related idea (being brainstormed now), that supports all this work being done. Making civic involvement more familiar and allowing ownership of it by anyone who wants to act.

## the Tools
**Research**: Aggregation, APIs, SQL mirroring and even RSS feed were investigated as possible means of transporting data from resources promoting (facebook) or hosting (moveon.org) actionable items related to civic engagement.

**Development**: *React.JS.* As a newcomer to React and not the most experienced Javascript writer, I'm learning the language and will be exploring as I go.
